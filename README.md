# Commands

Let's get straight to business. There are 5 categories these commands fall under. Fun, Moderation, Minigames, Economy, Misc. These will be listed in that order.

**Fun**

8ball - Just does the same thing as any generic 8ball command.

futurejob - Tells you what your future job will be.

baldness - Tells you how shiny your scalp is.

failure - Tells you what percentage of a failure you are.

yomama - Insults your mother. Lol.

skillrate - You give me the topic, I give you your skill rate.

ship - Mention 2 people and they will be shipped together. Won't work for people outside the server.

**Moderation**

ban - Bans the user.

kick - Kicks the user.

**Minigames**

guess - Starts a guessing minigame. You get 3 guesses to guess a number between 0 and 10. If you guess correctly, you get 1000 Wits.

vote - Vote for the bot! Less failure, less baldness, and more!

# FAQ

These questions aren't really frequently asked but I'm just going to predict what is asked.

**Why is the bot offline?**

Normally, you don't notice that the bot went offline. What happens is whatever minigame your in the middle of **WILL CRASH** and you have to start over. What also might have happened is that the host crashed and I have to go and get the bot online again. If it goes offline for an extended period of time, consider joining the Wit Support Server to let me know or to see if anything happened that required me to take the bot down.

**How come some people have better luck on commands?**

There are two possibilities for this. First, they might just have extremely good luck. The more likely possibility, is that they voted. Vote for Wit here: https://top.gg/bot/907067389806522450/vote.
